# Basic function and getting self state fuction
### void pxinit_chain()    
Startup CPU1(flight control system) and initialzie parameters which are set in parameter.c. 
### int pxget_cpu1ready()
After executing `pxinit_chain()`, CPU1 starts initialization for 3 seconds, including IMU calibraion. During initialization, put Phenox on the ground and do not move it.  
 - Return 1 when CPU1 finishes initilization normally.  
 - Return 0 when CPU1 does not finish initilization.  
If user move Phenox2 during initialization, this function returns 0 forever, so please execute `reboot` to reboot Phenox2 and try it again.

### pxget_motorstatus()
- Return 1 when Phenox2 rotates motors.
- Return 0 when Phenox2 does not rotate motors.

### void pxget_pconfig(px_pconfig *param)
Save struct of physical parameters (`px_pconfig`) to local variable "param".

### void pxset_pconfig(px_pconfig *param)
Reflect physical parameters which is set in local variable "param" to CPU1(flight control system). If users want to change parameters partially, copy current physical parameters using `pxget_pconfig()`, change parameters, and call this function as follows.  
```bash
  px_pconfig pc;
  pxget_pconfig(&pc);
  pc.duty_hover = 1800;
  pxset_pconfig(&pc);
```

### void pxget_selfstate(px_selfstate *state)
Copy struct of selfstate (`px_selfstate`) to local variable "state". Please see [Selfstate](../dev/state.md) for each members.

### void pxset_keepalive()
Send keep alive message from CPU0(Linux) to CPU1(flight control system). This function must be called periodically by users.

### int pxget_battery()
 - Return 1 when battery is nearly out.
 - Return 0 when battery is not nearly out.

When Phenox2 is in flight state (`PX_UP` or `PX_HOVER`) and battery becomes nearly out, CPU1 goes Phenox2 to down state (`PX_DOWN`) automatically. Down state conitinues for specified time which is written in `downtime_max`, a member of `px_config` struct (Please see [Parameters](../dev/param.md)).
Then, users have to shutdown Phenox2 by executing `halt` command manually.


### px_flymode pxget_operate_mode()
 Get current flight mode.  
  
 - `PX_HALT` means Phenox2 is suspend state.  
 - `PX_UP` means Phenox2 is up state.  
 - `PX_HOVER` means Phenox2 is hover state.  
 - `PX_DOWN` means Phenox2 is down state.  
 
### void pxset_operate_mode(`px_flymode` mode)
Change flight mode to 4 states of `px_flymode` (`PX_HALT`, `PX_UP`, `PX_HOVER`, `PX_DOWN`).   
If argument "mode" is set to `PX_UP`, Phenox2 starts rotating propllers (inserting 3 second of startup if previous state is `PX_HALT`) and going up for a specified time which is written in `uptime_max`, a member of `px_config` struct. Then, Phenox2 enters `PX_HOVER` state automatically by CPU1. 
When flight mode is `PX_UP` state, Phenox2 makes static thrust specified in `duty_up`, a member of `px_config` struct, in which ultrasonic sensor is not used to controll height.  
If  current flight mode is `PX_HOVER` and argument "mode" is set to `PX_DOWN`, Phenox2 goes down for a specified time which is written in `downtime_max`, a member of `px_config` struct. Then, Phenox2 enters `PX_HALT` state automatically by CPU1. 

### void pxset_visioncontrol_xy(float tx, float ty)
Control horizontal movement(axis X and Y) when it is in hovering state(`pxget_operate_mode()` == `PX_HOVER`), estimated by visual feature points of bottom camera.
Phenox2 calculate deviation of target potision(`tx`,`ty`) from current position (`vision_tx`, `vision_tx` members of `px_selfstate`), and try to go to target position (`tx`,`ty`). 

Behavior to track the target position is defined by two parameters for each axis,  which are named `pgain_vision_tx`, `pgain_vision_ty`(P-gain) and `dgain_vision_tx`, `dgain_vision_ty` (D-gain), members of  `px_pconfig`.

Horizontal position (`vision_tx`, `vision_tx`) is represented by image coordinate, so users need to fix it to real coordinate considering height from the ground.
For actual usage, please refer to [Move Phenox2 horizontally during flight(autonomous)](../tut/controll_move.md)

### void pxset_rangecontrol z(float tz)
Control vertical movement(axis Z) when it is in hovering state(`pxget_operate_mode()` == `PX_HOVER`), estimated by ultrasonic sensor.

Phenox2 calculate deviation of target potision(`tz`) from current position (`height` member of `px_selfstate`), and try to go to target position (`tz`). 

Behavior to track the target position is defined by two parameters which are named `pgain_sonar_tz`(P-gain) and `dgain_sonar_tz`(D-gain), members of `px_pconfig`.

### void pxset_dst_degx(float val)
Control angle of `degX`, which is defined in [Principal Axes](../start/directions.md) when Phenox2 is in hovering state(`pxget_operate_mode()` == `PX_HOVER`).

This function is not affected by horizontal location estimated by visual feature points of bottom camera (`vision_tx`, `vision_tx`  defined in `px_selfstate`), but only angle calculated using IMUs(`degx` in `px_selfstate`).   

Argument `val` is represented in 180 degrees notation, and -10~10 is recommended for safety drive.  

When this function is called, previsouslly called `pxset_visioncontrol_xy()` is disabled, and vice versa.

For actual usage, please refer to [Controll Phenox2 with joystick (manual)](../tut/controll_manual.md)

### void pxset_dst_degy(float val)
Control angle of `degY`, which is defined in [Principal Axes](../start/directions.md) when Phenox2 is in hovering state(`pxget_operate_mode()` == `PX_HOVER`).

This function is not affected by horizontal location estimated by visual feature points of bottom camera (`vision_tx`, `vision_tx`  defined in `px_selfstate`), but only angle calculated using IMUs(`degy` in `px_selfstate`).   

Argument `val` is represented in 180 degrees notation, and -10~10 is recommended for safety drive.  

When this function is called, previsouslly called `pxset_visioncontrol_xy()` is disabled, and vice versa.

For actual usage, please refer to [Controll Phenox2 with joystick (manual)](../tut/controll_manual.md)

### void pxset_dst_degz(float val)
Control angle of `degZ`, which is defined in [Principal Axes](../start/directions.md) when Phenox2 is in hovering state(`pxget_operate_mode()` == `PX_HOVER`).

Argument `val` is defined as follows.
  
 - if val is positive, Phenox2 rotates counterclockwise around degz. 
 - if val is negative, Phenox2 rotates clockwise around degz. 
 - if val is 0, Phenox2 stops roation around degz.
  
Rotation speed is set in `dangz_rotspeed`(member of `px_pconfig`) , so absolute value of `val` is not used for rotation speed.

### int pxset_visualselfposition(float tx,float ty)
Fix `vision_tx`, `vision_tx` (members of `px_selfstate`) to specified value "tx","ty". Thus, this function affects the result of `pxset_visioncontrol_xy()` function. (For this reasons, argument of `pxset_visioncontrol_xy()` shuld be given as relative potision from `vision_tx`, `vision_tx`).

This function is used when users want to reset current horizontal positions estimated by visual feature points of bottom camera.
