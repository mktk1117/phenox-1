# Install  software on custom microSD

Phenox2 has two CPUs(CPU0 and CPU1). CPU0 installs Linux(Ubuntu 13.04) and CPU1 operates flight controll system.  
Linux system is built on a microSD, so users can customize their own system by rewriting contents of a microSD. Also, binary of CPU1 and FPGA is also available. So users can download required software to operate Phenox2, and prepare a microSD card by yourself.  

In this section, we explain how to build Phenox2 software on custom microSD card.

Here we report the method using Ubuntu 14.04 as host-PC.

1\. Prepare a microSD (4.0Gbyte or upper)  
2\. Open terminal.  
3\. Inject a microSD to host-PC.  
4\. Execute "dmesg" command. And you can check device name of a micro SD as shown in Fig.1 or Fig.2.  
```bash
hostpc$ dmesg
```
Fig.1 shows the device name is "sdb", and Fig.2 shows the device name is "mmcblk0". Device name is changed according to the user's environment. So replace the following "sdX" to correct device name.

![Fig.1 dmesg result (sdX)] (/img/phenox_build_ja/2.3.find_identifier.png)
<div align="center">Fig.1 dmesg result (sdX)</div>

![Fig.2 dmesg result (mmcblkX)] (/img/phenox_build_ja/2.2.3.find_identifier_mmcblk0.png)
<div align="center">Fig.1 dmesg result (mmcblkX)</div>

5\. Before formatting a microSD, execute following command.  
```bash
hostpc$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1024 count=1
```
Then, eject and inject a microSD again.
6\. Create two partition to a microSD.  
```bash
hostpc$ sudo fdisk /dev/sdX
```
In fdisk, press key as follows  
 - press "n" and Enter  
 - press "p" and Enter  
 - press "1" and Enter  
 - press  Enter  
 - press "+256M" and Enter  
 - press "n" and Enter  
 - press "p" and Enter  
 - press "2" and Enter  
 - press  Enter  
 - press  Enter  
 - press "a" and Enter  
 - press "1" and Enter  
 - press "t" and Enter    
 - press "1" and Enter  
 - press "c" and Enter  
 - press "t" and Enter  
 - press "2" and Enter  
 - press "83" and Enter  
 - press "p" and Enter. Check that two partitions(FAT32 and Linux) are created.  
|/dev/sdX1 |   *   | XXXXXXX | YYYYYYY | BBBBBBB |  c | W95 FAT32 (LBA)|  
|/dev/sdX2 |   | XXXXXXX | YYYYYYY | BBBBBBB | 83 | Linux|  
 - press "w" and Enter  
After finishing, eject a microSD and inject it again.  
7\. Create file systems on two patitions with following command.  
```bash
hostpc$ sudo mkfs.vfat -F 32 -n boot /dev/sdX1
hostpc$ sudo mkfs.ext4 -L root /dev/sdX2
``` 
After finishing, eject a microSD and inject it again.  
8\. Download softwares from Phenox Lab, extract and copy them to a microSD.  
```bash
hostpc$ wget http://phenoxlab.com/static/phenox_boot_master.tar.gz
hostpc$ wget http://phenoxlab.com/static/phenox_ubuntu_master.tar.gz
hostpc$ tar zxvfp phenox_boot_master.tar.gz
hostpc$ tar zxvfp phenox_ubuntu_master.tar.gz
hostpc$ cp -a phenox_boot_master/* /media/<username>/boot/
hostpc$ sudo cp -a phenox_ubuntu_master/* /media/<username>/root/
```

9\. unmount and finish  
```bash
hostpc$ umount /media/<username>/root /media/<username>/boot
```
