# Streaming with node.js web serverThis tutorial explains following works using Ubuntu14.04 as host-PC.1. Startup Phenox2 from battery, connect to host-PC using ssh.  2. Launch web server using node.js to stream live images on browzer of host-PC.# 1. Setup supply power and communicationPlease setup supply power using battery as described in [Power supply](../start/power.md), and setup communication using ssh as described in [Communication](../start/com.md). # 2. Execute sample Run following command on Phenox2.```bashphenox# source /root/nodejs/nvm/nvm.sh/nvm.shphenox# nvm use v0.11.14phenox# source run/nodeimgserver.sh```Before running program, please put Phenox2 on the ground and do not move it until message "CPU0:Finished Initialization" appears. If users move Phenox2 during initialization, CPU1 detects movement and stops initialization. When this happens, please reboot Phenox2 by "reboot" command.  In host-PC, launch browzer and type `http://192.168.2.1:8192` on URL. Then, please check that images with visual feature points are stremed on browzer.  Also, this tutorial implements same behavior as [Fly Phenox2(autonomous)](./controll).
