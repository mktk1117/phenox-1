# Phenox Mechanical Overview

In this page, we explain the hardware structure of Phenox.
Phenox is composed of a frame, circuits, motors, propellers and a protector.

Phenox has its own coordinate and directions (front, back, left, right, top and bottom). Firstly, the side to which circuits are attached is the bottom side. In opposite, the side to which the propellers are attached is the top side.

The following pictures show the phenox from the top and from the bottom. We can see, on bottom side, devices such as cameras, SC card reader, CPU, and ultrasonic sensors. The detail of onboard devices are explained in the next chapter.

Phenox has two on-board cameras. The bottom camera is attached on the surface of the electric circuit. The front camera, is attached perpendicular to the circuit. As its name says, the direction the front camera faces is the front direction of Phenox. The front camera is illustrated in the following figure.

From the center of the body, the opposite side of the front is back, and right and left are defined in the natural manner.
