# Communication using Serial communication board
  
1. Prepare power supply source as described in [Power supply](power.md).
  
2. Attach the serial communication board to the main board  as shown in Fig.1. It is strongly recommended to protect the serial communication board with tape to prevent accidential short circuit between those two boards as shown in Fig.2.
  
3. When the host-PC is connected to the serial communication board with USB A-B cable, please check that device(FT232RL) is recognized by OS (There is no need to supply power to the main board in this stage.).
  
4. When the host-PC is running Linux OS, establish software of serial communication (minicom) as described in [Appendix](../appendix.md). If the host-PC is not running Linux OS, the configuration of the serial communication software is as follows (baudrate = 230400 bps, 1 stop bit  no parity).

5. Set the power switch to on state checking LED0 and LED1. LED0 and LED1 will turn on for about 2 seconds, and then turn off when the main board finished loading boot loader (u-boot) successfully. If no messages are sent from Phenox2 in this stage, please check the setup of serial communication software.  
Also if LED0 and LED1 continues on state, there may be problem of micro-SD card, and please refer to [FAQ](../faq.md).  
If host-PC gets messages from ``u-boot`` of Phenox2 (this situation happens when the main board receive input from host-PC before booting Linux.), please type ``run sdboot``, and Phenox2 starts booting Linux.

# Communication using WiFi module
Phenox2 becomes access point ("phenoxnet") after booting Linux automatically, and waits for ssh connection from host-PC. 
  
1. Prepare power supply source as described in [Power supply](power.md).

2. Insert WiFi module(WLI-UC-GNM) to USB port of Phenox2.
  
3. Set the power switch to on state checking LED0 and LED1. LED0 and LED1 will turn on for about 2 seconds, and then turn off when the main board finished loading boot loader (u-boot) successfully. If no messages are sent from Phenox2 in this stage, please check the setup of serial communication software.  
Also if LED0 and LED1 continues on state, there may be problem of micro-SD card, and please refer to [FAQ](../faq.md).
  
4. Wait for about 20 seconds and check the LED of WiFi module. When blue LED of WiFi modules starts blinking, Phenox2 finish booting Linux OS.
  
5. From the host-PC, find the wireless network access point. And connect to "phenoxnet" (SSID is "phenoxnet" and password is "phenoxnet").
  
6. From the host-PC, login to Phenox2 with following ssh connection.
The initial password is "root"
```bash
hostpc$ ssh root@192.168.2.1
```
  
Phenox2 accepts X11 forwarding by adding "-X" option of ssh command.

If users operate multiple Phenox2 at the same time, each SSID should be changed by modifying "setting/hostapd.conf" 

# Connection to the Internet
By default, Phenox2 establish "phenoxnet" to become access point itself using "hostapd". So if users want Phenox2 to connect to the Internet, users need to disable "hostapd" and set proper configulation to let Phenox2 to connect to another WiFi access point.

1. Disable setting of Phenox2 to lauch "hostapd" daemon after booting Linux.
```bash
phenox# mv /etc/rc2.d/S20hostapd /etc/rc2.d/refuge
```

2. Configure Phenox2 network to connect to another access point using "wpa_supplicant" to receive IP address from DHCP server. 

We prepare example of configulation in ã‚™`/root/setting/wlan-set-wli-uc.sh`. Users need to modify this setting according to user's environment, and run this script as follows.
```bash
phenox# source /root/setting/wlan-set-wli-uc.sh
```
Please check the detail of setting from the Internet with keyword "wpa_supplicant".
